Theocracy, according to the dictionary, is the "government of a state by immediate divine guidance or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided." The Oxford English Dictionary has this definition:

A form of government in which God (or a deity) is recognized as the king or immediate ruler, and his laws are taken as the statute-book of the kingdom, these laws being usually administered by a priestly order as his ministers and agents; hence (loosely) a system of government by a sacerdotal order, claiming a divine commission; also, a state so governed.
